#Geek is very fond of patterns. Once, his teacher gave him a pattern to solve. He gave Geek an integer n and asked him to build a pattern.

class Solution:
    def printTriangle(self, N):
        for i in range(N):
            for j in range(i+1):
                print('* ', end="")
                
            print()
